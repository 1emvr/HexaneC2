HexaneC2

This framework is a compilation of every publicly available resource I could think of with some very minimal UI/UX features. A good portion of this is derived from https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc.

The implant is not completely undetectable. There are plenty of IOCs that are intrinsic to the methods used here. If you know what they are, go ahead and change it :^)

This is meant to be a platform for malware developers to build from and tweak as they need. Mainly for myself.
